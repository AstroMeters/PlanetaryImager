Thanks Robin Glover(robin@sharpcap.co.uk)who provided the C# wrapper for ASI SDK1 and SDK2:

ASICameraDll.cs is a fairly simple wrapper around the C functions in the SDK DLL, although I have added code that checks the return code of every call and throws an exception in case of failure (in C#, error handling is usually by exception not return code). The exception message contains information about what API function was being called, what the parameters were and what the error code was, so really good for diagnostics/debugging.

ASICameraObjectModel.cs is an object model that wraps the functions in ASICamera.cs and makes the camera feel natural and easy to use for a C# (or VB.Net) developer. It's possible to write really neat object oriented code using this object model, starting with the ASICameras class to get the number of cameras and to get hold of a camera object.
